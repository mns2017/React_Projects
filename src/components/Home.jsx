            <p> We are ZOMBIE DEVELOPERS. A Zombie Developer will have excellent problem-solving skills. Often, they will need to have the ability to think outside the box to find solutions to complex problems that are not only creative but efficient. In addition, Zombie Developers must have excellent communication skills to ensure all parties involved are satisfied with the websiteâ€™s performance, from website development to content management.
            Zombie Developers typically work in teams that include other Developers, Software Developers, Web Designers and IT professionals. However, since they are often at the forefront of new technology, Zombie Developers can work closely with various individuals from different disciplines.
